 objective_singularity_chain_quest_desc:0 "Decades ago we transcended our biology and transferred our consciousnesses to immortal, mechanical shells. Now, it is time for us to take the next step; to shed the constraints of physical form, and upload our minds to a gargantuan computer; the Singularity. True immortality will be ours."
